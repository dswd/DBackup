#DBackup config file

# Local path that should be backed up
# The excludes file can be used to exclude certain files under this path
#
# Note: the exclude file must not contains paths outside the local path
#
LOCAL="/"

# Remote backend to store backups to
# The following protocols are supported:
#
# file:///some_dir
#   Backup to a mounted remote filesystem, e.g. NFS
#   Note: be sure to exclude the mount point from backups
#   Note2: the filesystem root / causes the URIs to start with file:///
#
# ftp://user[:password]@other.host[:port]/some_dir
#   Backup via FTP
#
# imap://user[:password]@host.com[/from_address_prefix]
# imaps://user[:password]@host.com[/from_address_prefix]
#   Backup to an imap server, e.g. gmail
#   Note: imaps:// uses SSL encryption for the connection
#
# scp://user[:password]@other.host[:port]/some_dir
# ssh://user[:password]@other.host[:port]/some_dir
#   Backup via SSH
#   Note: ssh:// and scp:// are the same
#
# webdav://user[:password]@other.host/some_dir
# webdavs://user[:password]@other.host/some_dir
#   Backup via webdav
#   Note: imaps:// uses SSL encryption for the connection
#
# Note: duplicity supports some more protocols, see duplicity(1) for more infos

REMOTE="file:///mnt/backup"

# Options to give to duplicity
# The following options can be used:
#
# --full-if-older-than 3M
#   Force duplicity to make a full backup if the last one is older than 3 months
#
# --asynchronous-upload
#   Upload one chunk while preparing another one
#
# --encrypt-key AABBCCDD
#   Use the gpg key AABBCCDD for encryption
#   Note: root needs to have at least the public key
#
# --gpg-options "--trusted-key 0011223344AABBCCDD"
#   Give special options to gpg
#   Note: the option string needs to be in quotation marks
#   Note2: the example --trusted-key forces gpg to trust a key
#
# --volsize 100 
#   Create volumes of a certain size (default: 25MB)
#   Note: the real size can be slightly bigger
#
# Note: duplicity supports some more options, see duplicity(1) for more infos
# Note2: DO NOT USE THE PARAMETERS --name AND --archive-dir
